UmlautLlama Amiga fonts
=======================

These custom Amiga fonts were extracted from .font files at http://umlautllama.com/projects/font/.
An additional Amiga font named Phyre is available there; as this file has been "crunched" 
with `explode.library` it is not readily convertible. 

Furthermore, a number of .bdf fonts are available at the link above, some of which reproduce the Amiga
system fonts and some are of unclear origin. Those are not included here.
